			<p>	The present Duterte administration is like copying the previous Marcos regime. The president already mentioned that he will put the entire country under martial law many times. One is which is when, two soldiers were reportedly killed by armed NPA guerillas in Aurora province. 
			<br><br>
			“Pag nagpatuloy kayo ng lawlessness niyo, and it is happening all over the Philippines, maybe I will declare martial law,” Duterte said.
			<br><br>
			He also vowed to finish all communist group members before his term ends in 2022. But even though this is his intention for declaring martial law, we should never forget what happened during the martial law in Marcos’ regime.
			<br><br>
			President Duterte already imposed martial law in Mindanao last May 2017 that lasted for 2 years. Anti-terrorism act was also passed which gives the government the authority to imprison any person who threatens to commit an act of terrorism. Speaking up against the government is one of the for someone to tagged as terrorists which violates our human rights. We have the right to speak up against the government when we see that something is at fault. The government might also abuse this act knowing the justice system here in the country only favors the powerful and rich. In short, this act is just used to silence the Filipino people.
